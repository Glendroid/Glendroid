- 👋 Hi, I’m @Glendroid
- 👀 I’m interested in getting back in touch with my techie roots.  My undergrad is in CompSci, but last 20 years more focused on the business side of startups.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS, Web Development basic and Python, along with other new things, with the goal of getting my tech hands dirty again :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects and possibly some business ideas.
- 📫 You can reach me by email at glenpol@gmail.com.
